# password-saver
It is often a case that a website requires you to register, make an account using email and a strong password.
Coming up with a strong password can be a tiresome thing since different websites have different requirements(for example: use at least one uppercase, use numbers
and symbols).
Even after you create one there's another problem: How to make sure you remember the password and for which website it used.
Wouldn't it be nice if you could just generate a password, bind it to the name of the website and an email you used and have a list of 
all your passwords with corresponding websites which only you know about right on your computer?

You can do this by using the "password-saver" app.
